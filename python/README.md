# Discount Applier Test Design Kata - Python version

See [top level README](../README.md) for exercise instructions.

The 'Notifier' class 'notify' method throws an exception. In a real implementation it would access the network. This exception is a placeholder to prevent you using this class in your unit test. The 'User' class has only one data member, the name. A real implementation would have considerably more fields.

## Running the tests in Python

To run the tests you will need pytest installed. 

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
